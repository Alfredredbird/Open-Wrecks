    "description": "# Sierra Madre (originally the USS LST-821)\n\nThe **USS Sierra Madre (AD-18)** was a United States Navy ship that played a pivotal role during and after World War II. Built in the early 1940s, it was originally a **destroyer tender** designed to provide maintenance and support for naval destroyers and smaller ships.\n\n### Key Facts:\n- **Launched**: 1943\n- **Type**: Destroyer tender\n- **Length**: 531 feet (162 meters)\n- **Service**: 1944\u20131960 (U.S. Navy), later transferred to the Philippines\n\n### Sinking Incident:\nThe **USS Sierra Madre** was decommissioned and sold to the Philippines, where it was renamed **BRP Sierra Madre**. In 1999, the Philippine Navy intentionally grounded the vessel at **Second Thomas Shoal**, located at approximately 9\u00b0 47\u2032 27.4\u2033 N, 115\u00b0 51\u2032 23.7\u2033 E, in the South China Sea. The grounding was a strategic move to assert territorial claims in the area.\n\nOver the years, the ship has deteriorated due to natural elements, but it remains a significant symbol of the ongoing territorial dispute in the region.\n\n### Current Status:\nThe **BRP Sierra Madre** is still stationed at **Second Thomas Shoal**, serving as a military outpost and a reminder of the geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea.\n",

    "description": "\ud83d\udef3\ufe0f Lepanto (formerly Deneb / Pireas)\n\nThe ship formerly known as **Deneb** and **Pireas** (IMO 5088564) was a general cargo vessel with a rich history spanning several decades. Built in 1962 in Sweden, it sailed under multiple names and owners before ultimately being abandoned at the Cemit\u00e9rio de Navios, Angola, a fascinating site of maritime relics.\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n- IMO Number: 5088564\n- Former Names: Deneb, Pireas, Lepanto\n- Type: General Cargo Ship\n- Length: 86 meters\n- Beam: 12.36 meters\n- Draught: 5.05 meters\n- Gross Tonnage: 1,597 tons\n- Builder: Falkenbergs Varv AB, Falkenberg, Sweden\n- Year Built: 1962\n- Flag: Netherlands (initially), later various flags\n- Coordinates of Wreck: 8\u00b040'28.81\"S 13\u00b024'58.64\"E\n\n## Career:\n\n- 1962: Launched as *Deneb* under Dutch ownership.\n- 1969: Renamed *Pireas* under Greek ownership.\n- 1980s\u20132000s: Operated as *Lepanto* with various owners.\n- 2000s: Decommissioned and abandoned at the Cemit\u00e9rio de Navios.\n\n## Sinking Incident:\n\nThe vessel ended its service life grounded at the Cemit\u00e9rio de Navios, also known as the Ship Cemetery near Luanda, Angola. This area is renowned for its collection of abandoned ships, many of which lie close to the shore and have become haunting maritime monuments.\n\n## Current Status:\n\nThe ship remains at the site, slowly succumbing to natural decay while serving as a silent witness to maritime history. Its story continues to captivate enthusiasts and historians, inviting further exploration into its past voyages and ownership.",

She was wrecked in 1929 on Nikumaroro Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. For decades, her remains served as a landmark before breaking up.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Facts\n- **Built:** 1911 by Wm Gray & Co, West Hartlepool  \n- **Original Name:** *Normanby*  \n- **Renamed:** *Norwich City* (1919)  \n- **Owner:**  \n  - 1911: London & Northern SS Co  \n  - 1917: St Just SS Co  \n  - 1929: Reardon Smith Line  \n- **Tonnage:** 4,219 GRT  \n- **Length:** 397 ft (121 m)  \n- **Propulsion:** Triple-expansion steam engine, 11 knots  \n- **Crew:** 35  \n- **Fate:** Grounded, 29 November 1929  \n\n---\n\n## History\n\n### Building\n- Sister ship to *Cloughton*, both built on the River Tees in 1911.  \n- Powered by a triple-expansion steam engine, carrying cargo in six holds.  \n\n### Ownership\n- Operated by Pyman Brothers, later Wm Reardon Smith & Sons.  \n- Registered first in London, later in Bideford, Devon.  \n- Converted from coal to oil fuel by 1924.  \n\n### 1928 Collision\n- Struck the Second Narrows Rail Bridge in Vancouver.  \n- Lost masts, funnel, and had superstructure damage.  \n- Repaired by Burrard Dry Dock.  \n\n---\n\n## Wreck of 1929\n- **Voyage:** Left Melbourne for Vancouver via Honolulu.  \n- **Grounding:** 29 Nov 1929, storm drove her onto a reef at Gardner Island (Nikumaroro).  \n- **Fire & Disaster:** Engine room caught fire; lifeboats capsized in rough seas.  \n- **Losses:** 11 men died (drowning, reef injuries, sharks). Survivors made camp ashore.  \n\n---\n\n## Rescue\n- Wireless operator managed to signal Apia, Western Samoa.  \n- British ship *Trongate* and Norwegian tanker *Lincoln Ellsworth* responded.  \n- Indigenous surfboat crew (from Tuvalu, Niue, Tokelau) bravely ferried survivors through dangerous surf.  \n- Survivors split between *Lincoln Ellsworth* (to Sydney) and *Trongate* (to Apia).  \n- Court of Inquiry praised islanders\u2019 seamanship; each awarded \u00a35 by the Royal Humane Society of Australasia.  \n\n---\n\n## Later Wreckage\n- Wreck remained visible for decades.  \n- By 1989: only keel, engine, bunker tanks, and one boiler remained.  \n- By 2016: boiler and engine gone; only scattered remains survived.  \n\n---\n\n## Legacy\n- Sometimes linked to **Amelia Earhart** investigations, as some theorize her transmissions referred to the *Norwich City* wreck on Nikumaroro.  \n\n---\n\n## See Also\n- Gardner Island hypothesis (Earhart disappearance)  \n\n---\n",
