# 🌊 Open-Wrecks

**Open-Wrecks** is a **free and open-source, self-hosted shipwreck documentor & tracker**.  
It lets you record, manage, and visualize shipwrecks on an interactive map ~ with full account management and approval workflows.

“Every wreck tells a story ~ Open-Wrecks helps preserve it.”
